# TDDI16 - Data Structures and Algorithms

Basically, you will learn about common data structures such as list, stack, search, tree (specifically search trees) and hashtables, their construction, distinctive features and how to use them practically. You will also be able to use different methods for searching and sorting and basic algorithms. Finally, you will be able to perform analysis of memory needs for simpler algorithms and data structures.
